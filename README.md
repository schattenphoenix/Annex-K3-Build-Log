# Annex-K3-Build-Log
Build log for a mostly sponsored build of the newly released Annex K3 printer.
Check it out here: <https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Gasherbrum-K3>

## Introduction
### Who am I?
I'm Alex.  
Some people in the community know my by exactly that name on Discord (Alex#8260). I've been pretty active in the community since about the middle of 2021 and have been meddling with basically everything I could get my hands on since then.  
  
I did create a server for gathering feedback on Voron Kits you can find here: [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/xXukSAEUwj)  
  

You can definitely find me there or on either the Annex, VzBot or Voron Discord.

### Why this build?
Some of you might ask this question.  
A K3 is expensive, arguably overengineered and most likely not the first choice for many. Nonetheless I love the design. It utilizes parts at their limit, far beyond what most people thought would be possible and it's a marvelous feat how well a machine like this functions.  
I've for a long time checked out the developement of this printer design now and through some recent events got a little nudge in the direction of building one. Thanks for that Jason (of LDO)!

### But it's so expensive!
I agree. The design is very expensive to build. It's so expensive that I've watched it for half a year and only recently decided to build one cause I could get a bunch of parts free.  
In fact Jason approached me after we talked about some other business and offered me to sponsor parts of the build to get me started. This kind of prompted me to see and try to get most of the build sponsored. Kind of a blank advertisement wall for everyone that wants to chime in.  
Since I cannot expect everyone to send me things for free, I will try to source everything else from smaller companies and add their names here in order to help them with a little extra publicity.

## Sourcing
In this section I will keep track of my sourcing efforts. Every item worth mentioning will contain a little reference to the source and whether it was purchased or sponsored. Things I currently have on my list to source will be added with empty checkboxes too.  
If you feel like supporting this build and get mentioned here, you can contact me on Discord (Alex#8260) or create an issue here.
